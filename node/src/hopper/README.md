# hopper
Micro routing for SubstratumNetwork traffic

## Purpose
The purpose of `hopper` is to interpret CORES packages, determining their next destination --
either inside the current SubstratumNode (i.e. to the ProxyServer or the ProxyClient)
or on to the next SubstratumNode in its Route.

It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/SubstratumNetwork/SubstratumNode/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
